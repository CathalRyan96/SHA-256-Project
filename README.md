# Theory of Algorithms Project

## Objective
You must write a programin the C programming language that calculates the SHA-256 checksum of an input. The algorithm is speciÔ¨Åed in the Secure Hash Standard document supplied by the (United States) National Institute of Standards and Technology. You are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.

## How to run and compile the program
Firstly you must clone this repository by entering the following into the command line:
```
https://github.com/CathalRyan96/SHA-256-Project.git
```
Once cloned correctly you must ensure that you have the GCC compiler installed. Once this is installed simply navigate to the project folder and run the following  command:

```
gcc -o sha256 sha256.c
```

Assuming the project compiles without any errors, simply run the program by using the following command:

```
./sha256 sha256.c
```
