# Objective
You must write a programin the C programming language that calculates the SHA-256 checksum of an input. The algorithm is speciﬁed in the Secure Hash Standard document supplied by the (United States) National Institute ofStandardsandTechnology[2]. Theonlypre-requisiteisthatyourprogram performs the algorithm — you are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.
