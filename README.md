# Theory of Algorithms Project

## Objective
You must write a programin the C programming language that calculates the SHA-256 checksum of an input. The algorithm is speciÔ¨Åed in the Secure Hash Standard document supplied by the (United States) National Institute of Standards and Technology. You are free to decide what input the algorithm should be performed on.

## How to run and compile the program
Firstly you must clone this repository by doing the following:
